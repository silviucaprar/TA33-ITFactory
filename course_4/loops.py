# exercitiu

# write a program that reads a sequence of numbers
# and counts how many numbers are even and how many are odd
# The program terminates when zero is entered

# What we need?
# var - odd numbers
# var - even numbers
# input()

# we declare 2 vars for odd number and even numbers and we set it to 0
odd_numbers = 0
even_numbers = 0

#read the number first
# number = int(input("Enter a number or type 0 to stop: "))
#
# # 0 terminates the execution
# while number != 0:
#     # Check if the number is odd
#     if number % 2 == 1:
#         # Increase the odd_numbers counter
#         odd_numbers += 1
#     else:
#         # increse the even_numbers counter
#         even_numbers += 1
